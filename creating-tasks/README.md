# How to create tasks for different topics

## Tasks Overview

- Create a minimum of 5-6 tasks per day
- Readme to introduce the task and the goals
- Tests for each task as an additional guidance for students

## How To create Tasks

- Use something like ChatGPT to create Readme. Look at existing courses to get
  inspiration and use it to create similar exercises. No direct copying.
- Use Code Gen AI or ChatGPT to create a test suite for each exercise.
- For this to work, each task needs to have enough depth in order to be able to
  create multiple tests per task
- Very large tasks can be split up. You can just copy the previous task solution as a starter for the
  next.

## To-Dos

- Check which AI products are best suited to generate tasks and tests
- Find out which testing tool should be used. Jest?
- Start generating tasks and tests and try solving them
